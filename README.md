## Datadog Setup

Datadog setup can be done by going through the below onboarding steps or by using apiKey directly if one exists. If an apiKey exists, use the Datadog Fluentd plugin to forward logs directly from Fluentd to your datadog account.

* Create an account in Datadog
* Run the datadog agent in your kubernetes cluster by deploying it with a helm chart
* To enable log collection, update datadog-values.yaml file given in the onboarding steps of datadog
* Once the agent starts reporting, you'll get an apiKey which we'll be using to send formatted logs through fluentd

Once datadog is setup, we can access logs via Logs > Search. We can also select the specific source that we want to get logs from. Adding proper metadata is the key to unlocking the full potential of your logs in datadog. By default, the hostname and timestamp fields should be remapped.

* Add all attributes as facets from Facets > Add on the left side of the screen in Logs > search

## Fluentd Installation

### OS / Virtual Machine
Ensure you have access to the Internet from VM. Recommended install is through fluentd's native OS based package installs:

| OS             | Package Manager        | Link                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CentOS/RHEL    | Linux - RPM (YUM)      | https://docs.fluentd.org/installation/install-by-rpm |
| Debian/Ubuntu  | Linux - APT            | https://docs.fluentd.org/installation/install-by-deb |
| MacOS/Darwin   | MacOS - DMG            | https://docs.fluentd.org/installation/install-by-dmg |
| Windows        | Windows - MSI          | https://docs.fluentd.org/installation/install-by-msi |
| Gem Install**	 | MacOS & Linux - Gem			 | https://docs.fluentd.org/installation/install-by-gem | 


```text
** For Gem based install, Ruby Interpreter has to be setup first, following is the recommended process to install Ruby

1. Install Ruby Version Manager (RVM) as described in https://rvm.io/rvm/install#installation-explained, ensure to follow all the onscreen instructions provided to complete the rvm installation
	* For installation across users a SUDO based install is recommended, the installation is as described in https://rvm.io/support/troubleshooting#sudo

2. Once rvm installation is complete, verify the RVM installation executing the command 'rvm -v'

3. Now install ruby v2.7.0 or above executing the command 'rvm install <ver_num>', ex: 'rvm install 2.7.5'

4. Verify the ruby installation, execute 'ruby -v', gem installation 'gem -v' and 'bundler -v' to ensure all the components are intact

5. Post completion of Ruby, Gems installation, the environment is ready to further install new gems, execute the following gem install commands one after other to setup the needed ecosystem

	'gem install fluentd'

```

After FluentD is successfully installed, the below plugins are required to be installed

````text
gem install fluent-plugin-concat
gem install fluent-plugin-datadog
gem install fluent-plugin-jfrog-siem
gem install fluent-plugin-jfrog-metrics
gem install fluent-plugin-jfrog-send-metrics
````

#### Configure Fluentd
We rely heavily on environment variables so that the correct log files are streamed to your observability dashboards. Ensure that you fill in the .env file with correct values. Download the .env file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/log-analytics-datadog/master/.env_jfrog)

* **JF_PRODUCT_DATA_INTERNAL**: The environment variable JF_PRODUCT_DATA_INTERNAL must be defined to the correct location. For each JFrog service you will find its active log files in the `$JFROG_HOME/<product>/var/log` directory
* **DATADOG_API_KEY**: APIkey from [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/)
* **JPD_URL**: Artifactory JPD URL of the format `http://<ip_address>`
* **JPD_ADMIN_USERNAME**: Artifactory username for authentication
* **JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN**: Artifactory [Access Token](https://jfrog.com/help/r/how-to-generate-an-access-token-video/artifactory-creating-access-tokens-in-artifactory) for authentication
* **COMMON_JPD**: This flag should be set as true only for non-kubernetes installations or installations where JPD base URL is same to access both Artifactory and Xray (ex: https://sample_base_url/artifactory or https://sample_base_url/xray)

Apply the .env files and then run the fluentd wrapper with one argument pointed to the `fluent.conf.*` file configured.

````text
source .env_jfrog
./fluentd $JF_PRODUCT_DATA_INTERNAL/fluent.conf.<product_name>
````

### Docker
In order to run fluentd as a docker image to send the logs, violations and metrics data to datadog, the following commands needs to be executed on the host that runs the docker.

1. Check the docker installation is functional, execute command 'docker version' and 'docker ps'.

2. Once the version and process are listed successfully, build the intended docker image for Datadog using the docker file,

    * Download Dockerfile from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/log-analytics-datadog/master/docker-build/Dockerfile) to any directory which has write permissions.

3. Download the Dockerenvfile.txt file needed to run Jfrog/FluentD Docker Images for Datadog,

    * Download Dockerenvfile.txt from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/log-analytics-datadog/master/docker-build/Dockerenvfile.txt) to the directory where the docker file was downloaded.

```text

For Datadog as the observability platform, execute these commands to setup the docker container running the fluentd installation

1. Execute 'docker build --build-arg SOURCE="JFRT" --build-arg TARGET="DATADOG" -t <image_name> .'

    Command example

    'docker build --build-arg SOURCE="JFRT" --build-arg TARGET="DATADOG" -t jfrog/fluentd-datadog-rt .'

    The above command will build the docker image.

2. Fill the necessary information in the Dockerenvfile.txt file

    JF_PRODUCT_DATA_INTERNAL: The environment variable JF_PRODUCT_DATA_INTERNAL must be defined to the correct location. For each JFrog service you will find its active log files in the `$JFROG_HOME/<product>/var/log` directory
    DATADOG_API_KEY: APIkey from [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/)
    JPD_URL: Artifactory JPD URL of the format `http://<ip_address>`
    JPD_ADMIN_USERNAME: Artifactory username for authentication
    JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN: Artifactory [Access Token](https://jfrog.com/help/r/how-to-generate-an-access-token-video/artifactory-creating-access-tokens-in-artifactory) for authentication
    COMMON_JPD: This flag should be set as true only for non-kubernetes installations or installations where JPD base URL is same to access both Artifactory and Xray (ex: https://sample_base_url/artifactory or https://sample_base_url/xray)

3. Execute 'docker run -it --name jfrog-fluentd-datadog-rt -v <path_to_logs>:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory --env-file Dockerenvfile.txt <image_name>' 

    The <path_to_logs> should be an absolute path where the Jfrog Artifactory Logs folder resides, i.e for an Docker based Artifactory Installation,  ex: /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/logs on the docker host.

    Command example

    'docker run -it --name jfrog-fluentd-datadog-rt -v $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory --env-file Dockerenvfile.txt jfrog/fluentd-datadog-rt'


```

### Kubernetes Deployment with Helm
